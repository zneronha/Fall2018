Current Features (October 1)
- Jupyter Notebook generates excel file with arrays of X,Y,Z data. Rows denote cell ID's and are robust across time. Columns denote different time frames.
- Visualization of all data points in Spyder with Mayavi, dragontails length 5 should work, 
- Partial implementation of variable length dragontail 
- Moviemaking is very simple in Spyder, generation of distinct frame (in an interactive setting) is functional


To Do 
- Streamline computations (there are a couple easy things to do that will make it run a lot faster)
- Implement annotations for points 


**NB.** Dragontail updating MUST use reset command and not the set command (even though the ball updating uses the set)
